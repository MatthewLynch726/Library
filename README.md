This was me doing the Tutorial 
ASP.NET Core Web App Tutorial - Part 1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTVcLFTgDqs

I learned a lot about MVC using this tutorial, specifically how to add in a service layer and create depate models for specific views. I left the tutorial at part 3 due to some database bugs I don't understand enough to fix right now.

I have gotten a lot from this tutorial so I think its time to move on and come back to it when my understanding is even better.
